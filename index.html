<em>8 September 2014</em>

<p>During the hackathon event I attended yesterday, I got to play around with some python libraries like opencv,numpy,etc.
I started liking python. Today, I started learning Django and I fell in love with it immediately. I wanted to explore more of python libraries/frameworks. I came across this <a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python" target="_blank">link</a> which is a list of all Python libraries and MoviePy interested me. I started reading the documentation and started realising how powerful and easier it is than using a GUI or a stand-alone application. 

During the FSMK-Summer Camp's cultural day, just few minutes before the event, a team had brought the songs and the start and end time of it. They were full songs and I had to cut it according to the given time limits. I was clueless on which app to use. There was no internet either. Then I did it somehow using some app, I think VLC.

So, I thought of using this library to write a script which does that job quickly and using only the terminal.

Here's how you can use the script:

</p>

<pre><code>$ python cutaudio.py filename start_time end_time y_or_n
 
</code></pre>
<em>Yes or No is for audio preview.</em>
<p>MoviePy is a dependency. I'm not sure if there are more. You can figure it out, I guess.</p>

<p>1. Didn't try what happens when the start_time is greater than end_time.<br>
   2. The converted file doesn't play in any player :P This script is almost useless if it doesn't play. It only previews in the terminal right now. I will fix it soon.
